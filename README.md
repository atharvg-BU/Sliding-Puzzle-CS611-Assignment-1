PlayGame.java



## Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my project I have created a general sliding puzzle class which has some general methods like creating the board, printing the board. These methods can also be used if we wish to play some other game like tic-tac-toe, and other such board game. 
In addition to this, I have also accepted input from the used as to how large a puzzle they want to play(by accepting rows and columns from them). The only constraint here is that both rows and columns should be greater that 2.
While creating the board me and setting the puzzle, I have checked if It is solvable beforehand by applying a mathematical formulation because not all random puzzled generated by the system may be solvable.


## How to compile and run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Clone the repository/download the PlayGame.java file
2.	This file contains both the classes PlayGame and the SlidingPuzzle class
